# 3D_arm_mobile_robot
This project is a detailed conceptual and technical implementation of an autonomous differential-drive mobile robot. It's designed to perform pick-and-place tasks using a 3D arm and mechanical gripper, integrated with a camera running YOLOv8 for shape detection, all within a ROS2 Humble environment. Packaged for deployment using Docker.
